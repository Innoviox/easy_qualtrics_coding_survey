Consent form goes here.

Note that the import format does not permit adding skip logic, so answering "No" to the consent still leads to the questions. To add the appropriate logic in Qualtrics survey creation after importing: click on the consent text to bring up the Edit Question pane at left, then look for Question Behavior on the left hand side (you may need to scroll down). Select Skip Logic. Choose "Skip from this question to End of Survey if Yes is not selected". Then click Confirm.

Also note that if you have not already done so, you'll want to delete the default question block at the top of the survey by clicking ... at top right of that block and selecting Delete.

Ok, finally here's the consent language. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Do you consent to participate? [Must be a Yes or No question since those are currently hard-wired options.]
